# Dynamic To Do List Using JavaScript

![intro](./images/intro.png)


## Purpose & Scope

* For this project, I wanted to further develop my JavaScript skills, so that was where my main focus was. So I created a dynamic to do list by creating event driven functions that allow you to add and delete items from the to do list.


## System Prerequisites
- Visual Studio Code


## Getting Started

* You can download the repository and run on it on your browser.
* Add new items to do the list in the input box and click to add or press enter.
* Once it's open, you can easily delete items from the to do list by clicking on the delete buttons next to next items.
* You can also cross out items you've completed by clicking on that specific item.

## Preview
